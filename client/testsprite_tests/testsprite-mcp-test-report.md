## 4️⃣ Key Gaps / Risks

1. **Terminal Runner Limitation:** The `generateCodeAndExecute` terminal command consistently fails with exit code 1 for frontend projects. This appears to be a TestSprite MCP v0.0.19 limitation — the frontend test plan is stored server-side but the terminal runner expects a local `testsprite_frontend_test_plan.json` file that is never created.

2. **Recommendation:** Frontend tests can be viewed and executed directly from the [TestSprite Dashboard](https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard). The PRD with all user flows has been successfully uploaded to TestSprite's cloud.
